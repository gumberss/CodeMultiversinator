## What is an Experimentation Platform?

An experimentation platform is a comprehensive technology system designed to help organizations test, measure, and optimize different elements of their products, features, and user experiences. By facilitating systematic experiments, typically in the form of A/B tests, this platform enables product and engineering teams to make data-informed decisions by evaluating how real users respond to various changes.

In a product development context, experimentation provides a structured method for validating ideas, improving features, and understanding user behavior. Experimentation platforms allow teams to move away from subjective assumptions or anecdotal evidence by providing statistically significant data on which versions of a feature deliver the best user outcomes. This leads to an iterative, data-driven approach to enhancing products.

An experimentation platform consists of several integral components that work together to facilitate, track, and analyze experiments. One of the foundational components is the user segmentation and targeting system, which ensures that users are divided into distinct groups for testing. This segmentation can be based on various criteria, such as demographics, behavioral patterns, or randomized assignment. The aim is to divide the audience in a way that ensures the reliability of experimental results, allowing each group to experience a different version of the product while preserving experimental validity.

Experiment management is another essential component, giving users the capability to create and configure experiments. This involves setting specific parameters, such as the duration of the experiment, metrics to be tracked, and the proportion of users exposed to each version of the feature or design. By providing a structured space for experiment configuration, this component helps ensure that each experiment is carefully planned to yield meaningful insights.

Experimentation platforms offer several benefits that support both product innovation and business growth. By validating changes on a smaller scale before a broader rollout, experimentation reduces the risks associated with new feature launches. Testing ideas through controlled experiments enables teams to detect potential issues early and understand what works best without exposing all users to unproven changes.

Beyond risk reduction, experimentation platforms empower teams to make decisions rooted in data rather than intuition. Insights derived from experiments allow for objective, evidence-based development that prioritizes user preferences and behaviors. This data-driven approach often leads to improved user satisfaction, increased engagement, and higher conversion rates, as products are continually optimized to meet user needs.

An experimentation platform also provides scalability, which is essential for organizations conducting large-scale or complex experiments. These platforms are built to manage numerous simultaneous tests across different segments, allowing large organizations to continuously improve diverse aspects of their product ecosystems. This scalability also enables businesses to test multiple ideas concurrently, facilitating faster development cycles and more efficient resource allocation.

## Progressive Rollout

Creating a successful experimentation platform is a long-term journey, so we’re beginning with a progressive rollout system to deliver value quickly.

Progressive rollout is a strategy to gradually release a new feature to a subset of users before making it widely available. Unlike a full release, where all users get the update simultaneously, progressive rollout enables teams to manage exposure gradually, often starting with a small percentage of the user base. This helps detect and resolve issues early, ensuring that any negative impact is contained within a small group. Progressive rollout also allows teams to evaluate user feedback and make improvements iteratively.

In a progressive rollout, users are typically divided into cohorts, and each cohort receives the feature sequentially. Initially, only a few users might access the new feature. As confidence grows, more users are granted access until the feature is fully deployed. This phased approach ensures that problems can be addressed promptly, avoiding disruptions to the entire user base.

###  Dark Launching

Dark launches which involve running a new feature or service alongside an existing one, without exposing the feature to end-users. This approach allows teams to assess the feature’s impact, identify potential issues, and ensure stability before public rollout. When a customer interacts with the product, the existing codebase continues to handle the user experience, while the dark launch system processes the same inputs in the background without affecting the user’s experience.

For example, a new recommendation algorithm can be tested in shadow mode, processing real user data without affecting what users see. The system can collects data on the new algorithm’s performance, helping teams evaluate its effectiveness, identify bugs, and assess load capacity. Dark launch thus provide real-world usage metrics and valuable insights, giving developers confidence in the feature’s readiness before broader exposure.

A progressive rollout can be combined with dark launching when the impact of a new feature is uncertain. In this approach, a small percentage of customers experience both the standard and dark flows, allowing us to carefully assess changes while minimizing any potential impact.

## Real Time monitoring

As we introduce dark launches and progressive rollouts into our system, it becomes essential to have monitoring capabilities. Real-time monitoring tools provide us with instant insights into the system’s health. These insights are critical to detect issues early, mitigate potential disruptions, and ensure smooth rollouts, ultimately enhancing our system's reliability and customer satisfaction.

### Why Real-Time Monitoring?

Implementing dark launches and progressive rollouts means gradually exposing users to new features without full deployment. This process allows us to evaluate performance under realistic usage conditions and gather feedback before a complete release. However, this gradual exposure also requires careful observation to understand whether the feature behaves as expected and remains stable as more users engage with it.

Real-time monitoring benefits include:

###### 1. Early Issue Detection
- Monitor key metrics in real time, such as response times, error rates, and CPU/memory usage, to immediately detect anomalies.
- Identify potential issues before they impact a broader audience, reducing the chance of large-scale failures.

###### 2. User Impact Visibility
- Understand how the feature affects user experience at various stages of the rollout, allowing us to catch regressions or unintended behaviors.
- Obtain visibility into user engagement and gather insights into potential bottlenecks, leading to data-driven improvements.

###### 3. Risk Mitigation for Dark Launches
- Track shadow execution data to observe how the feature might perform in the real world without direct user interaction.
- Ensure the system can handle additional loads from shadow executions, which can reveal infrastructure weaknesses.

###### 4. Controlled Rollout Feedback
- Observe metrics across user segments to assess the feature’s readiness for full release. Real-time feedback on progressive rollouts allows for adjustments or rollbacks as needed.
- Validate that target customer groups receive an optimized experience, helping us fine-tune customer segmentation.

## Full Experimentation Platform 

Implementing a platform for progressive rollout and dark launching provides the foundational capabilities of an experimentation platform. By managing feature releases and monitoring performance metrics, these strategies introduce critical aspects of experimentation: segmentation, feature control, and data collection.

1. **User Segmentation**: Just as progressive rollout branch the code for different user, an experimentation platform expands this capability, allowing more fine-grained user segmentation based on various attributes, like demographics or behaviors.
    
2. **Data Collection and Analysis**: Progressive rollout with dark launch provide a baseline for understanding feature impact. An experimentation platform would extend this by tracking detailed metrics, comparing control and test groups, and using statistical significance testing to measure the results in a business way, not only technical.
    
3. **Rollout Flexibility**: Progressive rollout controls user exposure. In an experimentation platform, this would evolve into A/B testing or multi-variant testing, where multiple versions can be exposed simultaneously, and user behavior is analyzed across variations to identify the best-performing option.

The most significant difference between a progressive rollout and an experiment is data validation. A progressive rollout aims for a complete migration from one architecture to another. In contrast, an experiment doesn't imply that changes will be permanently adopted in the system, as treatment groups may negatively impact metrics while the control group remains unaffected.

Creating a progressive rollout system enables the possibility of segmenting data on the data warehouse by experiment groups.

### Data warehouse

A data warehouse is a centralized repository specifically designed for storing and managing large volumes of structured data from multiple sources within an organization. Unlike transactional databases, which are optimized for quick data entry and retrieval operations, a data warehouse is built to handle complex queries and data analysis at scale. Its primary purpose is to support business intelligence (BI) activities, including reporting, data mining, and decision support.

#### Architecture of a Data Warehouse

A typical data warehouse architecture consists of several layers:

- **Data Sources**: The original data sources, which may include CRM systems, ERP systems, and third-party databases, feed into the warehouse.
    
- **ETL Process (Extract, Transform, Load)**: Data is extracted from source systems, transformed into a consistent format, and loaded into the warehouse. The transformation stage may include data cleaning, integration, and standardization to ensure quality and consistency.
    
- **Data Storage Layer**: This is the core repository where data is stored. This layer is optimized for quick retrieval of large datasets, supporting various storage models like star schemas, snowflake schemas, or data marts for different departments.
    
- **Data Access Layer**: BI tools, analytics platforms, and user applications access data from this layer, facilitating reporting, visualization, and advanced analytics.

#### Benefits of a Data Warehouse

- **Improved Decision-Making**: A data warehouse enables data-driven decisions by providing accurate, comprehensive, and timely data.
- **Enhanced Data Quality and Consistency**: By integrating data from diverse sources and applying transformation rules, it ensures a consistent view of the organization.
- **Historical Insight**: With a historical view of data, it enables trend analysis, performance tracking, and forecasting.

The initial goal of this project is not to build a complete data warehouse, but rather a simplified system that stores data in a database, establishes key metrics and guardrails, and enables validation to determine if a feature has negatively impacted customers.
